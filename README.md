# etch-a-sketch
Etch-a-Sketch / sketch pad build in Javascript, CSS and HTML.

Through this project, I learned a lot about event handling, DOM manipulation, how to control and manipulate styles, classes, and other attributes in JS, and how to do more advanced styling in CSS to try to mock-up a traditional etch-a-sketch. 

Features: 

Default black pen, click and drag to draw. 

Blue pen, click and drag to draw. 

Random pen (rainbow button) - chooses a random RGB value for the pen color, click and drag to draw. 

Eraser - removes drawing on click and drag 

Grid button: toggles grid lines on and off 

Clear button: resets canvas

Grid slider input - resizes grid, starting at 10x10, with an interval of 10, up to 100x100.
